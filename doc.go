// Package mjpeg implements support for mjpeg (sometimes M-JPEG) video streams.
//
// Each frame of the stream is sent as an encoded JPEG. This, while it has
// quite a bit of overhead, is simple to work with both from a client and server
// point of view. Clients update the stream frame-by-frame with a golang
// image.Image.
